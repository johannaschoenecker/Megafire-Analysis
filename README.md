# Megafire Analysis

This repository contains the R scripts and google earth engine scripts (.txt) and analyses for the project  
**"Conifer forest recovery is compromised by compact and large high severity burn patches within megafires"**.

## Overview
This project combines remote sensing and field data to analyze:
- Burn severity across megafires
- Vegetation recovery and post-fire dynamics
- Spatial relationships between burn severity, distance to unburned forest, and vegetation type

## Data required for analyses

Calfire FRAP database- fire shapefiles
Sierra Nevada region shapefile
RdNBR rasters for each fire- 30m spatial resolution
Vegetation classification training data


## (Intermediate) outputs produced 

Annual vegetation classification composites for the Sierra Nevada region- 30m spatial resolution
Elevation, slope, aspect, topographic roughness index (TRI) & topographic position index (TPI) rasters- 30m spatial resolution
Classified RdNBR rasters for each fire- 30m spatial resolution
PRISM annual absolute composites (mean tmean, tmin, tmax, tdmean, vpdmin, vpdmax; sum ppt)- 2,000m spatial resolution
PRISM annual anomalies (based on 30-year normal) - 2,000m spatial resolution
