# Megafire Analysis

This repository contains the R scripts and analyses for the project  
**"Megafires in the temperate conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California (1985–2020)"**.

## Overview
This project combines remote sensing and field data to analyze:
- Burn severity across megafires
- Vegetation recovery and post-fire dynamics
- Spatial relationships between burn severity, distance to unburned forest, and vegetation type

## Repository structure
- `Data/` — input data (not all synced to GitHub)
- `Figures/` — generated plots and maps
- `Outputs/` — model results and summaries
- `Scripts pub/` — reproducible scripts for publication
- `Scripts/` — local working scripts (ignored on GitHub)

## Data
1. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio.
2. Install required packages (see the first script in `Scripts pub/`).
3. Run analyses step by step following the numbered scripts.
